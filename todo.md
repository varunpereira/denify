- restrict page depending on user with jwt
- edit account
- admin user type
- live updates with socket.io with websocket, for when user is on viewport
- image uploading, store them with cloud file storage
- stripe notifcations done with webhooks
- fix style based on web design principles
- category should be array
- cors since anyone can access endpoints
- use express so can have path based routes instead of file based for be
- o auth so can also sign in with google
- sanity for file storage?
